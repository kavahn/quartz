- ## Importance of graphics
	- #### A typical reader will look at 
		- ###### The title
		- ###### The abstract
		- ###### The introduction
		- ###### The figures, graphs, charts
		- ###### Skim other sections based on need
- ## What makes a good graphic
	- ####  You need to properly introduce the graphic
		- then having it explained and introduced the reader will under stand what the graphic means and the importance
- ## Types of graphics
	- #### A lot can be considered graphics
		- ###### To convey a message by means of drawing lines
			- text 
			- pictures
			- diagrams
- ## Number can lie
	- #### For example

# Use Tufte's measures to optimize graphics
- ## Tufte's measures
	- #### Maximize data-ink ratio
		- data-ink ratio = data ink/total ink used in graphic
		- ###### Keep it simple
	- #### maximize data density
		- data density = # entries in data matrix/ area of data graphic
		- ###### If comparing graph, merge
	- #### Avoid lie factors
		- lie factor = size of effect shown in graphic/size of effect in data
		- ###### avoid changing the graph to lie

# recognize how to select the most appropriate graph type

	- ### Bar graphs
		- ###### Grouped bar: 
			- ![[Graphics-20231126073256475.webp|154]]
			- Compare relationships
		- ###### Stacked bar:
			- ![[Graphics-20231126073308101.webp|168]]
			- compare parts to whole
		- ###### Deviation bar:
			- ![[Graphics-20231126073319409.webp|147]]
			- difference from an expected value
		- ###### Sliding bar:
			- ![[Graphics-20231126073329530.webp|152]]
			- how groups split according to some characteristic
	- ### Scatter plots
		- ###### Shows correlations between two uncontrolled sets of data
		- ![[Graphics-20231126073516657.webp|333]]
	- ### Pie charts 
		- ###### comparing parts to a whole
		- ###### good for small number of segments
	- ### Colour
		- ###### determine whether document will be reproduced in colour or black and white
		- ###### keep in mind that people will often print in black and white
			- avoid reference like "the red line shows"
			- pay attention to contrast issues
		- ###### general rule is that a diagram should be understandable reading a photocopied photocopy

# Incorporate graphics into text and oral presentations
- ## Ensuring graphical integrity
	- ###### # of variables changing in graphic = # of variables changing in data
	- ###### Use clear labels
	- ###### show change in data, not change in designs variation
	- ###### Show standardized units for money
	- ###### Demonstrate cause and effect
	- ###### Use the correct type of graphic
- ## Graphics in oral presentations
	- #### Think PGP (particular, general, particular)
		- introduced figure
		- point to a particular data point
		- describe the overall trend
		- reinforces by explaining

# Case study of Challenger
- ## The disaster 
	- #### the shuttle relied on temperature sensitive o rings
		- many people did not see the damage and tempeture correlation because of the figure
