## Short Sentences
- #### When using short sentences there's a few problems
	- ###### Short sentences sound choppy
	- ###### There's only one idea per sentence
	- ###### looks childish
- #### Stress time language
	- ##### Cadence
		- when there is a short sentence your cadence slows down and you speak very choppy

## Language
- #### Comma splice 
- #### Patterns for general language
	- ###### When we talk we use a lot of meaningless words
		- we should quantify/clarify in the  persuasive paper
			- ###### Example
				- "Ensuring better problem solving and decision-making skills by non-senior management can avoid the next crisis situation."
					- ###### we can remove "situation" as it is redundant because crisis is a situation
				- "Approximately 60% of our work is a repeat nature with only minor variations. This repeat work is specifically of the inspection and quality control type and does not require higher education"
					- ###### we can remove and optimize redundant words like nature -> repetitive activities.
- #### Specialized Language
	- ##### There is a lot of times you will need to talk to non-engineers and you will need to use layman terms
		- ###### The only difference between jargon and specialized language depends solely upon the expertise of the audience
- #### Patterns for Acronyms
	- ###### On the first instance define the acronym 
	- ##### Pointers
		- dont define common acronyms
		- limit the amount of different acronyms
- #### Patterns for noun strings
	- ###### Don't have too much noun strings
		- break them up so there easy to read and under stand for reader
			- prepositions
	- ###### The royal order of odjectives

- #### Pattern for Prepositional Phrases
	- ###### In... on... of.... of... of... at...
		- if you have too many prepositions in one sentence you might need to break the sentence down, check if you need to make a new sentence or combine ideas
	- ###### Pointers
		- avoid phrasal verbs 
- #### Patterns for punctuation
	- ###### If you don't have enough punctuation readers might not know that there's a new independent clause 
		- a reader might group an indepedent clause into the wrong clause
