## What is a control statment
- ###### Helps control the program
	- order and such
- ### Sequence
	- #### Sequence structure
		- statments execute one after another
- ### Selection
	- if
	- if else
	- switch
- ### Iteration
	- while 
	- do while
	- for

## Selection Structure 
- ### IF Statement
	- #### used for single selection
		- selects action if condition is TRUE
		- skips if false
- ### IF else statement
	- #### used for double selection
		- selects action if true
		- skips to next action if false
- ### Switch statement
	- #### used for multiple selection
		- selects on of many actions depending on condition
- ### Break
	- immediate exit from current statement
- ### Continue
	- skips the remaining statements in the loop body and goes with the next iteration

## Iteration structure
- ### Loops Statements 
	- #### Preforms statements repeatedly while true
- ### While and for loops
	- #### if action initially true:
		-  prefrom action zero or more times
	- #### If condition initially false
		- action is not executed
- ### Do while:
	- #### While loop
		- test continuation statement before executing loop body
	- #### Do while loop
		- tests the loop continuation statement after executing the loops body
		- *do statment* executes before checking the while condition, contiues until while is false
