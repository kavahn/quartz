This C++ code contains definitions for two functions that generate the lyrics of the song "The 12 Days of Christmas" in two different styles. Let's go through each part of the code.

### Preprocessor directives and global definitions
```cpp
#include <fmt/format.h>
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define C std::cout<<
int /*whitespace*/ d, q;
std::vector /* must leave whitespace here */
   s { "st", "nd", "rd" },
   g { /* ... gifts ... */ };
```

- `#include <fmt/format.h>` includes the `fmt` library which provides facilities for formatting and printing.
- `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` is a GCC-specific header that includes most of the standard C++ library headers. This is not a best practice and should generally be avoided in favor of including only necessary headers.
- The `#define C std::cout<<` defines a macro to abbreviate the `std::cout <<` statement.
- `int /*whitespace*/ d, q;`: Variables `d` and `q` are defined as global integer variables and are initialized to 0.
- `std::vector /* must leave whitespace here */` defines two vectors `s` and `g`. Vector `s` contains ordinal number suffixes, and vector `g` contains the gifts from the song.

### Function `DaysOfChristmas_smallCode`
```cpp
void DaysOfChristmas_smallCode() {
   /* ... function code ... */
}
```
This function prints the lyrics using loops and a macro. It uses the `C` macro to print to `std::cout`. It iterates over the 12 days, using the `d` variable for days and `q` for the "quantity" of gifts. The comma operator and conditional operator (`?:`) are used in a way that might appear non-intuitive but are valid C++.

### Namespace statement
```cpp
using namespace std;
```
This line allows all standard library names to be used without the `std::` prefix. This is generally discouraged in larger projects due to the risk of name collisions.

### Function `processGift`
```cpp
void processGift(const int &day) {
   /* ... function code ... */
}
```
This function uses the `fmt::format` function to format and print the appropriate gift line, it maintains a static counter `count` that is incremented every time the function is called.

### Function `DaysOfChristmas_switch2`
```cpp
inline void DaysOfChristmas_switch2 (int dayLimit = 6 ) {
   /* ... function code ... */
}
```
This function prints a different version of the song for a custom `dayLimit`. It uses `switch` statements to handle each day's suffix and to call `processGift` with appropriate arguments.

### `main` function
```cpp
int main( ) {
   /* ... main code ... */
}
```
The `main` function demonstrates various uses of the variable name `q` which is also a global variable. It's meant to show a potential for confusion during debugging due to variable shadowing and scope.

1. `constexpr long long q{1};` and `const double q{2.2};` locally shadow the global `q`.
2. `for (char q{'a'}; auto &e : s)` uses a local `q` for a loop variable.
3. `array<string, 12> s;` is an `std::array` that is distinct from the global `s`.
4. `std::accumulate` is used twice to concatenate strings: first from the `s` array, then reverse concatenation of the `g` vector.
5. Calls to `DaysOfChristmas_smallCode()` and `DaysOfChristmas_switch2()` invoke the two different song-producing functions.
6. `processGift(13);` will throw an `std::out_of_range` exception because `g` only has 12 elements.

Finally, the `main` function returns the value of the global `q`.

### Exception handling
```cpp
catch (const std::out_of_range& ex) {
   /* ... catch block code ... */
}
```
The `try` block is around the body of the `main` function, and the `catch` block is designed to catch out-of-range exceptions, output an error message, and return 3.

Overall, the code brings together several aspects of C++ (classes, loops, conditionals, exception handling, etc.) and uses them in a context that could potentially be confusing, as it is designed to demonstrate and test understanding of variable scope, headers inclusion, preprocessor directives, and exception handling mechanisms.
