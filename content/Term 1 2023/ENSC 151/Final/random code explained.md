# String compare
The provided code is a C++ program that demonstrates string comparison using the `std::string::compare` method and a custom `displayResult` function to output the comparison results. Let us explain each part of the code:

1. **Comments and `#include` directives**:
    
    - The first line is a comment indicating that this is a user's first C++ program.
    - The `#include` directives add various headers that are assumed to be used in the program, however, not all are utilized in this snippet.
2. **`displayResult` function**:
    
    - This function is defined to take two parameters, a constant reference to a `std::string` (`const std::string& s`) and an `int` (`int result`). The `const` keyword suggests that the string `s` will not be modified.
    - The function checks the value of `result` and prints the string `s` followed by a comparison result such as "== 0", ">0", or "<0" based on whether `result` is equal to zero, greater than zero, or less than zero, respectively.
    - `std::endl` is used to flush the buffer and output a newline character.
3. **`main` function**:
    
    - This is the entry point of the program where execution starts.
    - Four constant strings (`std::string`) are defined (`s1`, `s2`, `s3`, and `s4`) with various text content. `s4` is initialized to be the same as `s2`.
4. **String comparisons using `compare` method**:
    
    - The `std::string::compare` method is used to compare substring parts of the strings. Comparisons are made in several ways and the results are sent to the `displayResult` function to be displayed.
    - `s1.compare(s2)` compares the whole of `s1` ("testing code") with `s2` ("rat"). It checks lexicographical ordering and can return less than, equal to, or greater than zero.
    - `s1.compare(2, 2, s3, 0, 2)` compares a substring of `s1` starting at index 2 with length 2 with a substring of `s3` starting at index 0 with length 2. Essentially, it compares "st" from "testing code" with "ca" from "carpet".
    - `s4.compare(0, s1.size(), s2)` compares a substring of `s4` starting at index 0 with the same length as `s1` with `s2`. Because `s1` is longer than `s2` ("rat"), this will probably return a value indicating `s4` is longer than `s2` (unless there is a null character in `s4`). Note that `s4` is initialized as a copy of `s2`.
    - `s3.compare(0, 2, s1)` is intented to compare a substring of `s3` starting at index 0 with length 2 with `s1`. However, the code actually specifies a length of 3 for the substring of `s3`. This is a mistake and should be `s3.compare(0, 2, s1)` to compare "ca" from "carpet" with "testing code".

The output of the `main` function will be a series of lines printed to the console indicating the results of the comparisons. The exact output will depend on the lexicographical ordering of the strings.

Here is what you might expect each `displayResult` call to output, though the exact results depend on the string contents:

- For `displayResult("s1.compare(s2)", s1.compare(s2));`, since "testing code" would lexicographically come after "rat", it would likely output `s1.compare(s2) > 0`.
- For `displayResult("s1.compare(2, 2, s3, 0, 2)", s1.compare(2, 2, s3, 0, 2));`, "st" comes before "ca", so it would likely output `s1.compare(2, 2, s3, 0, 2) < 0`.
- The call `displayResult("s4.compare(0, s1.size(), s2)", s4.compare(0, s1.size(), s2));` is not meaningful since `s1.size()` exceeds the length of `s4`. In fact, `compare` is not designed to work this way, and it might result in undefined behavior. It is likely intended to be `displayResult("s4.compare(s2)", s4.compare(s2));` which would output `s4.compare(s2) == 0` since `s4` was initialized with `s2`.
- For `displayResult("s3.compare(0, 2, s1)", s3.compare(0, 3, s1));` the mistake in the code will affect the comparison, but if corrected, "ca" compared to "testing code" would likely output `s3.compare(0, 2, s1) < 0`.

# Reading Vectors
The code provided consists of a C++ program that includes headers for standard IO, arrays, vectors, and standard exception handling. It also defines a function `someFunction` that processes vectors of integers and a `main` function that demonstrates the use of `someFunction`. Let us go through this code step by step:

1. **`#include` directives**: These preprocessor directives include the headers for the functionality that will be used in the program.
    
    - `<iostream>`: This header file is needed for input and output stream operations, like `std::cout` for console output.
    - `<array>`: This header defines the `std::array` container, but it's included and not used in this code snippet.
    - `<vector>`: This header file is needed for `std::vector`, which is a dynamic array used in the code.
    - `<stdexcept>`: This header includes standard exception types such as `std::runtime_error`, but it's not used in the provided code snippet.
2. **`using namespace std;`**: This line includes the entire standard namespace, which allows the program to omit `std::` prefix before standard library classes and functions (e.g., `cout`, `vector`). However, the code does use the `std::` prefix, which makes this using declaration redundant.
    
3. **`someFunction` definition**: This is a function that takes a constant reference to a `std::vector<int>` as its parameter. The `const` keyword indicates that the function will not modify the contents of the vector.
    
    - The function iterates over the elements of the vector using a range-based for loop. The `const int& item` loop variable gives us read-only access to each element in the vector to prevent copying and potentially modify elements, which isn't allowed in this case due to the `const` declaration.
    - Inside the loop, `std::cout << item << " ";` prints each integer followed by a space to the standard output (the console).
    - After the loop, `std::cout << '\n';` prints a newline character to end the line of output.
4. **`main` function**: This is the entry point of the program.
    
    - Two `std::vector<int>`s are defined and initialized with different sets of integers: `vec1` with `{1, -2, 4}` and `vec2` with `{3, -1, 5, 2, 7}`.
    - `std::cout << vec1.size() << '\n';`: This line prints the size of `vec1` followed by a newline character. The size of `vec1` is 3.
    - `someFunction(vec1);`: This line calls `someFunction`, passing `vec1` as the argument. The function prints the elements of `vec1` followed by a newline character.
    - `std::cout << vec2.size() << '\n';`: Similar to the earlier print statement, this line prints the size of `vec2` followed by a newline character. The size of `vec2` is 5.
    - `someFunction(vec2);`: This line calls `someFunction` again, this time passing `vec2` as the argument. The function prints the elements of `vec2` followed by a newline character.

When this code is run, the output will be:

```json
3
1 -2 4 
5
3 -1 5 2 7
```

Each vector's size is printed, followed by the elements of the vector. The elements are separated by spaces, and each block of output (the size and the elements) is followed by a newline.
