## The information Function
- ##### The information we gain in learning which out com has occurred
	- if N possible outcomes are all likely
		- $\log_{2}(N)$
			- ###### Example
				- if there is a 1 in 10 chance 
					- N=10 total information is 3.122 bits

## How we communicate 
- #### Over a distance
	- ###### Fire
		- 0 = no fire, do nothing
		- 1 = WE ARE UNDER ATTACK SEND HELP
	- ###### Aeneas Method
		- using water level to encode letters
	- ###### Polybius square
		- using matrices arrays to communicate 
- #### Rapid long range
	- optical, low-bandwidth
	- ###### Chappe semaphore 1792
		- used by Napoleon still in use during the Crimean war
	- ###### Electro chemical telegraph
	- ###### Relay
	- ###### Electric Telegraph
		- MORSE CODE :)
	- ###### Baudot code
		- uses polybuis square 
			- arrays to encode ascii letters
	- ###### Transatlantic cable
		- wildman whitehouse 
			- first cable had no relay switches . It relied on high 
- #### Rapid mid rang
	- acoustic, medium bandwidth
- #### Slow
	- messenger 
	- 

## Digital VS Analog
- ###### Digital was more favored because of its ease
- #### Analog
	- better noise to signal ration 
- #### Digital
	- if signal is blocked/noise is introduced the system fails

## Quantitation
- #### "compresses" the information so it there is less information
	- like gray or dark gray
		- if you only need white and black just cap it to 2 bits and compress
