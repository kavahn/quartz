	- dr kevin mccallum
	- former chief engineering for sk ministry of environment
	- a study and initial findings
		- ##### Relationship between society and air quality 
			- ###### Sociaty gets more mad over water quality than air because, of how fast its conequenses react
- ### Water quality
	- texas vs walerton,=> brain eatin amoeba found in texas water supply

			- ###### if the waste water isnt treated properly people can get very sick
				- should it be up to engineers to plan or to use a reactonary approch

## ENgineering and Development
- ### Big technologies for developing nations
	- #### bad idea
		- requires skilled labour, expnsive and requires a lot of maintance
	- #### Appropriate technology
		- ##### clear, cheap and relable 
			- ###### an ideal solution may be "sub-optimal"

## Appropriate projects
- ### Not appropriate
	- ##### the kenya chavao water project
		- used a diesel water pump but the chief would keep the money
	- ##### Simputer Project
		- a low cost computer for children/poor
			- attempt to digitize local region, 240$ usd
			- 240 is cheap for westerners but extreamly expensive to a vilager

## Triple bottom line


## Strong vs weak sustainability
- ### Strong sustainability 
	- #### human capital complements natural capital and are not interchangeable
	-  Natural capital does not decrease
- ### weak sustainability 
	- #### human capital substitutes natural capital
	- human produced plus natural capital does not decrease
- ### population growth 
	- people are worried that human population growth would fuck up sustainability
		- "a mininmum of 3.5million people will starve to death this year, mostly children. but this is a mere handful compareed with the numebr that will be starving in a decade or so. AAnd it is now too late to take action to save many of the people"
			- the actual population growth is that growth rate goes up but death goes with it
				- ###### food production increases faster than the death rate because of technology
	- four factors that postpone deplation 
		- ###### 1. scarity increases the price
		- ###### 2. extration methods improve\
		- ###### 3. subsatutes 
- ### The Energy system

		- #### consumers dont really care about oil and gas all they care it is charged by electricity 
- ### Global warming
	- #### The Carbon Cycle
		- ##### Carbon sequestration -(mark jaccard)
	- #### 11 engineering criteria that lead to sustaniabilyt
		- 1. process at ambient or lowe teperatures and pressures
		- 2. optimally selected molecular composition
		- 3. 
- ### Product lifecyce
	- #### Planned obsolencens
		- ###### Right to repair
			- instead of buying new we can maintain and fix 
		- ###### Cradle to grave
			- design -> useful life -> landfill
			- design -> usful life -> usefull life -> land fill
			- desgin -> usful life -> design 
			-
