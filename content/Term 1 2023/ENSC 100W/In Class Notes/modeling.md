# possible test material for [[ENSC 100W]]

## Design
- #### What have we covered for design
	- 1. what problem are we solving?
	- 2. is the solution appropriate
	- 3. is this solution feasible
		- ###### generally speaoking, engineers do not guess!!!!
			- medeling, prediction, scaling 
				- good engineers understand 
					- 1. solutions have multiple answers
					- 2. no solution is perseft
					- 3. the trade offs taken are understood and justified
	- 
- ### Mikes "laws"
	- 1. pick resistors between (300ohm to 56k ohm)
	- 2. when soldering, lowest profile components are installed first
	- 3. never jump a connecton over/over a device
	- 4 colour code
	- at SFU you never use teh green common ground
	- when is a device friend? too hot to touch
- ### Efficiency
	- #### Only engineers really care about efficiency
		- -> tons of steel out/tons of coal in 
			- always pay attention to the scaling of the demention
		- -> when we increase the size look for the effiencency change
			- -> scalar
				- any unit can be applied anywhere
- ### Mental models
	- ##### -> mental models is any thing that helps the user to understand 
		- they are good when they simplifing for users
			- bad when making how the actual workinging of a thing is simplified to be wrong
- ### Human behavour
	- #### People as explanotory creatures
		-  why do people hit buttons multiple times when first try fails?
			- "in teh absense of external informations, people are free to let their imaginations run frree as long as the mental models they develoop account for the facts"
- ### Hard to compute problems
	- ###### Turbulent combustion
