## The Polar Coordinate system
- #### We chose a point in a plane that is called the pole and is labeled O.
	- ###### Then we draw a ray starting from O called the polar axis (Usually corresponds to the positive x-axis)
		- if point P is any other point in the plane, let r be the distance from O to P and let $\theta$ be the angle between the polar axis and the line OP

				- ##### This point is represented by the order pair $(r,\theta)$ and $r,\theta$ are called polar coordinates of P.
	- ##### We extend the meaning of polar coordinates to the case which r is negitive by agreeing that the points $(-r,\theta)$ and $(r,\theta)$ lie on the same line through O the same radius from O but opposite
