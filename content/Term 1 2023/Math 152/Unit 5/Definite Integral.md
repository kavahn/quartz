- ### The definite integral
	- ##### It is defined as the area from x value a, to x value b expressed by the integral $\int_{a}^{b}f(x) \, dx$
		- if it is a shape ie. triangle, square, semicircle we can just use its area formula, as they are defined as the same thing
	- ##### You can get the integral from a to c by using two integrals added to each other 
		- $\int_{a}^cf(x)  \, dx=\int _{a}^b f(x)\, dx+\int _{b}^{c}f(x) \, dx$
	- ##### The integral from a to b will be the same as |b to a|
	-  $\int_{a}^{b}f(x) \, dx=-\int_{b}^{a}f(x) \, d$
		- ###### We can use [[Even Odd Functions]]
			-  to solve really complicated a->b integrals
