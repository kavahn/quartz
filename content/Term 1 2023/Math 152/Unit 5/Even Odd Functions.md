- ### Even and odd functions
	- #### if a function is even
		- $\int _{-a}^{a}f(x) \, dx=2\int _{0}^a f(x)\, dx$
	- #### if a function is odd
		- $\int _{-a}^{a}f(x) \, dx=0$
	- #### Ex.
		- ###### a. $\int _{3}^3 (2x^4+3x^{2}+4)\,dx$
			- => $2\int _{0}^{3} (2x^4+3x^{2}+4)\, dx$
				- this makes it much easier as we can use just zero so we dont need to calculate the lower bound
		- ###### b. $\int_{e}^e \frac{e^{u^2}\sin u}{u^2+10}\, du$
			- => since its an even function being times by an odd the top of the fraction is odd then since its divided by even its still **odd**
				- => since integrand is odd we know that its 0
	- #### How to find if its even or odd
		- $f_{1},f_{2},f_{3}$ these are odd but $f_{4}$ is even, we can think of it of it all being that all of the odd f are negatives and when we multiply with the even function it still is odd! same thing with division
