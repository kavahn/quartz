# Unit 11.3 of [[Math 152]]

# Integral for convergence
- ### In order for this to work 
	- $a_{n}=f(n)$ 
		- ###### The function must be
			- positive 
			- continuous
			- decreasing
			- $x\geq 1$
- ## Basic idea
	- Lets say we have a series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}$ we could in order to find out if the series is convergent turn it into an improper integral
		- $\int _{1}^{\infty}a_{n} \, dx$ 
			- ###### and if this integral gives us a constant the series converges
