- ### Volumes of integrals
	- #### Definition
		- we can think of it as slicing apon the x axis and wake the crosssectionoal area the lake the itnegral from a -> b
			- $V=\int _{a}^{b}A(x) \, dx$
				- $\lim_{ n \to \infty } \sum_{i=1}^n A(x_{i}^*)\Delta x$
	- #### Ex. 
		- ###### 2.7, find the volume of a pyramid whose base is a square with side b and whose height is h
