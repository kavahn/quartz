# Unit 11.1 of [[math 152]]

# What is a series?
- #### when a funtion that is being added to infinity, not the terms to infinity!

# Convergence 
- #### Partial sums
	- ###### if for example we have the series $\sum^\infty_{n=1}2n$ and we want to know if it converges we can check the sequence (the 2n part) and its partial sums
		-  the sequence {sn} is convergent and $\lim_{ n \to \infty }s_{n}=s$ exists as a real number, then the series is convergent
			- however since it grows forever it diverges 
	- ### NOTE: this is different from the Divergence test!!!! 
- #### Divergence test
	- to know if a sum is divergent we can use the divergent test
		- ### Definition:
			- if we want to know if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{n}$ we can take the limit of $a_{n}$ to infinity $\lim_{ n\to \infty }a_{n}$ and if the limit =/= 0 its divergent but if its 0 it it might be convergent
				- ### THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM CONVERGENCE PARTIAL SUMS!!!
