## Curves Defined by Parametric Equations
- #### Imagine a particle moves long curve c
	- ![[Parametric Equations-20231106025013768.webp]]
		- #### It is impossible to create an equastion with just f(x) because it fails VLT.
			- But the x and y- coordinates of the particle are functions of time t
				- therefore we can write $x=f(t), and ,y=g(t)$. 
					- ###### This is a convenient way of describing a curve

## Parametric Equations
- #### Using the def, we can suppose that x and y are both given as functions of t (a parameter), by the equation 
	- ###### $x=f(t), y=g(t)$ 
		- this is called parametric equations. Each value of t determines a point (x,y), which we can plot in a coordinate plane. As t varies, the point $(x,y)=(f(t),g(t))$ varies and traces out a curve.

## Examples
- #### EX 1.
	- ###### Sketch and identify the curve defined by the parametric equations
		- $x=t^{2}-t$ and $y=t+1$
			- each value of t gives a point on the curve
				- using a table we can get an outline
					- ![[Parametric Equations-20231106030020454.webp]]
						- now we can trace
							- t=-2 is the starting point and you would graph it sequentialy as its defined by the parameter.

## Eliminating the Parameter
- #### you can algebraically remove the parameter from the equation by solving for t then solving for y
	- ### Ex. 
		- $x=2t-1$ and $y=\frac{1}{2}t+1$
			- we can solve for t
				- $t=\frac{x+1}{2}$ and $t=2y-2$
					- from there we can make an equation by canceling out t
						- $t=\frac{x+1}{2}=2y-2$
							- there we can solve for y
								- $y=t=\frac{x+1}{4}+1$
