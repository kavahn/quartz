## Matlab
- #### Code
	- ###### much like c++
		- but its a interpreted language
			- this executes the instructions direcctly
- #### Plotting
	- ###### Very easy to plot a function
- #### Simulation
	- ###### The built in stuff makes it very easy to simulate stuff 
		- AM modulation
		- autmatic car transmition 
		- simusscape
			- unidirectional ]
- #### Toolbox
	- ##### Package of functions for specific topic
		- ##### EX
			- ###### symbolic math
				- basicly CAS but stronger
				- very intiutive -> similar to latex
			- optimization
			- communications
			- control system
			- DSP system
			- image processing
			- robotics system
