## 3.6 Determining the formula of a compound
- #### Combustion analysis
	- when a substance containing carbon and hydrogen is burned it is converted to co2 and h2o (just like normal shit)
- ### Determining the formula of a compound
	- ###### ex
		- a 15g sample of a hydrocarbon is burned in oxygen to give 50.769g of co2 and 10.386g
			- $50.769gCO_{2}*{\frac{1molCO_{2}}{44.01gCO_{2}}}*{\frac{1molC}{1molCO_{2}}}=1.154mol$
		- A compound containing only phosphorus and oxygen is analyzed to contain 43.64% P by mass what is the empirical formula
			- Assuming 100g $43.64gP*{\frac{1molP}{30.97g}}=1.409106molP$
				- $100-43.64g=56.36gO*{\frac{1molO}{16.00g}}=3.5225molO$
			- $\frac{P_{1.409106}0_{3.5225}}{1.409106}$ dividing through the smallest%
				- $P_{2}O_{5}$ 
		- A sample of a compound that is known to contain only C=40.92%, H=4.58% and O the molar mass is 176.1
			- %C = mass of C in 1 mol/mass of 1 mol of the substance
				- $\frac{{40.92}}{100}*176.1g=72.060gC*{\frac{1molC}{12.01}}=6molC$
			- %H
				- $\frac{4.58}{100}*176.1g=8.06538gH=\frac{1molH}{1.008g}=8.00molH$
			- %O
				- $\frac{54.50}{100}*176.1g=95.9745g*\frac{{1molO}}{16.00g}=5.998molO$
			- ###### $C_{6}H_{8}O_{6}$
- ### Molecular formula
	- #### Empirical formula will not represent all the actual numbers of atoms
