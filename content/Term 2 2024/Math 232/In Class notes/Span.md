## Span of the coordinates
- ### The hats
	- ##### we can think of the x and y axis as these scalars $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ 
		- it is like the complex plane (WOW)
			- ###### IE: $$
\begin{matrix}
3 \\
-2
\end{matrix}
= (3)\hat{i}+(-2)\hat{j}
$$
			- Very important -> "basis vectors"
				- showing the xy coordinate system
	- ##### We can make our own basis vectors (hats) 
		- to make infinite ways to make one vector
- ### linear combination
	- ###### when we add some type of basis vectors it creates a linear combination
	- #### the "span" of $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ is the set of all their linear combinations
		- $a\vec{v}+b\vec{w}$
			- letting a and b very over all real numbers
				- ###### This allows us to write any vector on the 2d plane
- ### Span in 3d space
	- #### Span in 3d space is like 3d printing
		- when we try to take the span for a 2d vector (vector with two numbers only) in 3d all the possible values (span) will only draw a flat 2d plane through the origin of teh 3d space
