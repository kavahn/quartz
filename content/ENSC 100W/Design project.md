 
# Final project of [[ENSC 100W]]
## Design thinking
- ##### read the project description (Canvas)
- ##### Pick anything 'reasonable' your group can build
- ##### Brainstorm problems to be solved
- ### Constraints
	- ##### it has to be...
		- ###### safe
			- no weapons, explosives, radioactive material
		- ###### built to scale
			- No space elevators or hyperloops
		- ###### quantifiable 
			- Have a measurable or definable outcome.
				- E.G. building a 'water wheel' is not enough. Building a water wheel to generate up to X amount of power continuously
		- ###### Designed and working
			- There is no design plugging a solar panel into battery ):
- ##### you dont need to be an inventor 
	- you can improve an existing design 
- ##### good projects solve a problem
	- there should be some challenge that can be overcome

## Get training for the cool shit :)
- #### ask him 

## Funding
- ##### Wighton Fund (i.e. Max = $100)
- ##### Purpose: Engineering development fund for student projects
	- Reimburses 'low-volume' parts purchased for projects
		- Yes: RPi, microprocessors, specialized sensor, etc
		- No: resistors, capacitors, toy motors, etc...
	- all reimbursed material must be returned to me in lab 1 at the end of the term. (i.e. you cannot keep reimbursed parts)
- ##### Qualifications 
	- ###### one person on the team does the purchases/ makes a claim
	- ###### ENSC design projects that have a practical purpose and are real

## Upcoming group Assignment (due week 5)
- ##### teams brainstorm and record up-to three problems to solve this term 
	- ###### teams can record more than five but five will grant full marks.
- ##### problems should be 'reasonably realistic'
	- ###### i.e. No teleportation project's
	- ###### problems should lead to a practical design
- ##### While brainstorming 
	- ###### do not worry about money

## SFU Remote tools
- ##### SFU GITLAB
- ##### Canvas group homepage



## Next steps
- ### Finalize design and prepare for oral presentations
- #### Determine your measures of success and what you will demo
	- focus to prove primary functions
	- Quantify the output
	- speed, direction capacity
	- incremental testing
	- how will you visualize the demo
- #### Divide project into sub-system and assign work for each group member
