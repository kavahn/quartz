# possible quiz material for [[ENSC 100W]]

## The tale of two cultures 
- art schools have shakespear 
	- engineers have the laws of thermodynamics

## Limitations of the newtonian model
- ### Newtonian discribed everything that we can see
	- ###### however there is magnetic phenomena

## The laws of thermodynamics
- ### Zeroth law:
	- #### The transitive property exists
		- If a is thermal equibibrium with b
			- and if b is in thermal equibilium with c
				-  therefor a is equal to c
- ### first law
	- #### Energy/heat can transfer
		- for any system the total work going in or out equals the total heat going in or out
- ### second law
	- #### The entropy of a closed system can only go down
		- energy wants to spread out
- ### third law
	- #### As the temperature approaches absolute zero
		- the entropy of a system in equilibrium goes to zero.

## developments in thermodynamics
- ### stirling 
- #### sadi carnot, 1796-1832
	- french engineer
		- describs how heat=work can be done at low to high pressures
- ### Energy
	- #### Watt = 1 joule/second
	- #### One kilowatt-hour is 3.6MJ
		- more ways to break down = more energy stored
	- #### Available energy (Exergy)
		- the available energy of an energy source is the amount that can be converted to mechancial work
			- $W<Q_{H}(T_{H}-T_{c})$$/T_{H}$
		- ###### Entropy is times errow
			- you cant reincrease entropy 
			- it is *irreversable*t
