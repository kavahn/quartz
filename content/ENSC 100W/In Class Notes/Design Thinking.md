## What is design?
- #### difference between 
	- Analysis (i.e study/observe)
	- investigation (i.e. inquire)
	- design (i.e. Synthesis)
- ### design Vocabulary
	- ###### Functonal requirement:
		- What the device has to do
	- ###### Design Parameters:
		- what you can vary to meet the requirements
	- ###### Constraints
		- restrictions 
- ### Design Stages
	- ##### 1. Desgin involves a progression from the conceptual:
		- "should our power source be x or y"
	- ##### 2. through an intermediate stage aka configuration
		- "should the x be b strong or a strong"
	- ##### 3. to the final stage of filling in the numbers on the engineering drawings "detail design"
		- "shoudl these be xcm bolts or 2.8 do?"
- ### Objective Functions
	- ##### the overall goodness of the design
		- ###### out come should be quantifiable

## Science vs Engineering
- ###### Science
	- looks at what is and asks why?
	- if the universe is in state X, what happens next?
		- (adapted from G.B. Shaw, Back to methuselah)
- ###### Engineering 
	- dreams of what has never been, and asks "why not?"
	- if I want the univerese to be in state x, what must happen first
		- (Ross TenEyck)
